// Given a positive integer n, find the number of perfect squares that are less than n in the sample space of perfect squares. The sample space consists of all perfect squares starting from 1 (i.e., 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, â€¦)
// Input: n = 9
// Output: 2
// Explanation: 1 and 4 are the only Perfect Squares less than 9. So, the Output is 2.

class Solution {
    static int countSquares(int n) {
        return (int)Math.sqrt(n - 1);
    }
}
